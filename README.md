# Meal Tracker
##### A calorie counter.

#### By Shruti Priya

## Description
A web application that allows users to keep track of their meals by name, details, and calories. Users should be able to log a day's meals, including details about the meal as well as the number of calories in the meal. Meals only need to be logged for one day (not multiple days).
 For Example:
 ---------
Name: "Hamburger"
Details: "Didn't get a soda or cheese on my burger!"
Calories: 354
---------

---------
Name: "Fries"
Details: "I only ate half of them."
Calories: 365
